**This folder contains code for coalescent simulation with divergent substitution rates among local populations**

Please see the following assumptions about each population structure:

**Symmetric migration model:** two local populations, but migration rate is the same regardless of population sizes

**Conservative migration model:** two local populations, and migration rate is adjusted by the ratio of population sizes

**Stepping stone model:** a one-dimensional array of local populations with equal migration rates
